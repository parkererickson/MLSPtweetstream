# MLSPtweetstream
The whole process begins when a user tweets their two images to @mlphotostyle. The program uses Twitterâ€™s streaming API to get tweets with @mlphotostyle tagged, and determines if they can be processed by looking at the media files. If they are able to process, the relevent information is extracted and recorded in a database on AWS RDS. The program also triggers an EC2 m5.xlarge instance to spin up to process the two images. For the code, check out this Github repository.
